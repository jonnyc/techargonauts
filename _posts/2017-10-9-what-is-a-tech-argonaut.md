The name of Tech Argonauts was derived from Greek Mythology from the story of Jason and the Golden Fleece. Jason was a mythological prince and hero who was charged with retrieving the Golden Fleece to reclaim his kingdom. For his epic quest, Jason assembled a crew of heroes and captained the ship named Argo. His crew were known as the Argonauts, which translates directly to "Argo sailors".

The idea of Tech Argonauts was inspired by this story of adventure and discovery. The technological frontier can be daunting but the Tech Argonauts are ready to navigate it with you. To read more about the Argonauts and the Greek Mythology of Jason and the Golden Fleece, follow the links below.
